title: Story Mapping Workshop
---

Building a new product from scratch is no small task.  In fact, sometimes the most challenging part is getting started!  Having some product/project management experience has definitely helped me take on some of these challenges, but story mapping and user stories are still relatively new concepts for me.  However, thanks to tonights workshop with Groupon’s Todd Webb, I feel much more comfortable tackling product development related challenges through story mapping!

### Here are some key highlights from workshop:

- **User Stories** are short descriptions meant to help define what a user needs and the actions they must take to use a particular feature. User stories should always be from the users point of view and are used to help you plan. Most User Stories use the following syntax:


<div class="pa4">
  <blockquote class="athelas ml0 mt0 pl4 black-90 bl bw2 b--blue">
    <p class="f5 f4-m f3-l lh-copy measure mt0">As a blank (User, Admin, etc.)…I want to blank (sign up, log in, etc.)…So that I can blank (write a blog post, view a profile, etc.</p>
  </blockquote>
</div>

- A **backlog** is a big collection of User Stories and helps you determine what to do next.

- A **Story Map** acts as placeholders for conversation and encourages multiple business units to participate.  Furthermore, they arrange user stories in such a way that it helps the team understand the functionality of your product, identify holes, and effectively plan releases that deliver value to the end customer.

- **Creating a Story Map** using post it notes and arranging them on a wall in such a way that everyone can easily participate and contribute. Each post it note should contain a user story, the person performing the action (i.e. user, admin, etc.), the priority in terms of business value, and the frequency of the action. You should organize the notes in sequential order by priority.
