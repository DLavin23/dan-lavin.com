title: Code Academy Demo Day

If you live in Chicago and hate the cold, then I suggest you join Code Academy next winter because this has been the fastest 3 months of my life! I know I vowed to blog every week in my first post, but it turns out that learning web development is pretty damn hard, thus my blogging took a bit of a backseat so I could focus on code and take advantage of the many different events/meetups available to an aspiring developer in Chicago.

Now that I’ve got my excuse out of the way, you’re probably asking what I’ve learned over the last 3 months, right? Well, to be perfectly honest, the most important thing I learned is that there’s so much more to learn and Code Academy is simply the first step on the right path towards a new and exciting career.  What I really want people to understand is that building great software is a craft and it takes a lot of time and effort before you can call yourself a master. A few months ago I had ZERO programming experience but thanks to Code Academy I not only have a strong technical foundation but also know I’m not alone on this journey. There is an awesome community and a growing network of alumni that are willing to help as long as you’re willing to stay hungry and passionate. After all, that’s what Code Academy is about, following your passion.

So what’s next? Well, after Code Academy demo day tomorrow, I’m back to building! I consider myself lucky to have found my passion at such an early age and I can’t wait to continue learning. If you found any of these ramblings interesting and would like to talk about my Code Academy experience, a new product idea, or any job opportunities please reach out, I’d love to hear from you!
