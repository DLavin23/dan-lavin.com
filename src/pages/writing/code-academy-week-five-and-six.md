title: Code Academy Weeks 5 and 6
---

For the few people out there reading this blog (Hey Mom!), I apologize for not posting last week, things have really picked up over the last couple of weeks!  Thus, I’m going to combine the last two weeks into one blog post for the sake of
being efficient.

To be perfectly honest, the last couple of weeks have been quite the blur, as we’re really starting to move at an accelerated pace.  We’ve learned a ton of information over the last month or so and it’s crazy to think that we’re already half way done with the program! In the last few weeks alone we learned the following topics:

- Model Associations
- one to many relationships
- many to many relationships
- JSON API’s
- using ruby gems
- git and git hub
- user authentication (login/logout)

Oh and if that isn’t enough, our class also got together and built 6 web apps in 48 hours at the second annual Code Academy “Start-up Weekend,” not too shabby for a group of people that have been programing for less than 2 months!  Start-up weekend was awesome and is deserving of it’s own blog post (I promise I’ll get to it later) but the most valuable thing I got out of that weekend was version 1 InfoGraphic.ly, which is the web app I’m building for demo day. I’ll discuss the idea in more detail in future posts but InfoGraphic.ly aims to provide a simple solution to information overload. The goal is to help people organize and understand the information the consumer on the web using data visualization and infographics. That of course is the final version. Version 1…well let’s just say it’s very “limited” but it’s a working prototype that I’m very proud of.

For those of you unfamiliar with the Start-Up Weekend concept and want to learn more, check out this blog post on [built-in-chicago](http://www.builtinchicago.org/profiles/blogs/6-web-apps-one-weekend).

Not only did Start-up weekend provide a great way to put some of the skills we’ve learned to use, it also gave us a glimpse as to what it would be like to work on a software team in a professional environment.  It was really cool to see our team work together to solve problems and it was really cool to see a bunch of people working their ass off all weekend to build something.

I’ll leave you with some parting advice…If you want to start your own technology based company or want to work for a tech based start-up, I highly encourage you to attend a Start-Up weekend, it’s a phenomenal learning tool. Now, back to building InfoGraphic.ly!
