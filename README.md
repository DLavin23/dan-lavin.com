# Introduction
Welcome to the personal site of Dan Lavin! This site is built using Eleventy, which is a super neat static site generator that optimizes for speed and simplicity. Plus the creator is from Nebraska, and I'm from Nebraska, which is what we in the biz like to call...synergy!

## Why
My goal with this website is to keep it as simple as possible. There are a handful of libraries and frameworks that are super interesting and totally worth exploring—React, Tailwind, Stimulus, Alpine, Vue just to name a few—just not in this repo. Maybe I'll introduce those at some point, but for now, it's about keeping this codebase simple, understandable and optimized for the following:

- writing
- little to no maintenance
- speed!
- accessibility

If I don't update anything for 6 months, I should be able to get things running and make changes with little effort.

## Getting Started

```
$ nvm use
$ npm install
```
