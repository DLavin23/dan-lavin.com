# Introduction
Welcome to the personal site of Dan Lavin! This site is built using Eleventy, which is a super neat static site generator that optimizes for speed and simplicity. Plus the creator is from Omaha, Nebraska and I'm from Omaha, Nebraska, which is what we in the biz like to call...synergy!

## Why
My goal is to keep this website, and the technology used as simple as possible. When in doubt, leave it out. There are a handful of libraries and frameworks that are super interesting and totally worth exploring—just not in this repo. React, Tailwind, Stimulus, Alpine, Vue—the list goes on! Maybe I'll introduce those at some point, but for now, it's about keeping this codebase simple and understandable.

1. Focus on writing
2. Doesn't require a lot of maintenance
3. If I don't update anything for 6 months, I should be able to get things running and make changes with little effort.

## Getting Started

```
$ npm install
```
