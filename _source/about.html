  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I love products that solve real problems, for real people. I enjoy design that is both simple and intuitive. I believe that talking to actual customers is the best way to make sure you're building the right product. I embrace change. Failure happens from time to time. That's OK, as long as you learn from your mistakes. I value strong communication. It's impossible to build a great product if design, engineering, and the business are not working together as one team. Finally, I approach every problem with an "empty cup" and a "beginners mind".
